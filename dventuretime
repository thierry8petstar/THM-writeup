	======================================

	Hi there bananaheads!!!
	So you found my file?
	But it won't help you if you can't answer this question correct.
	What? I told you guys I would help and that it wouldn't cost you a thing....
	Well I lied hahahaha

	Ready for the question?

	The key to solve this puzzle is gone
	And you need the key to get this readable: Gpnhkse

	Did you solve the puzzle? 


	bananaheads!!! Only yes or no!!!
	bye!!!


------Decrypt "Gpnhkse" with key "gone" it in vigenere
------output : Abadeer


After getting that we come back to helper file and we answer yes to ythe first question and our result to the second one
	Did you solve the puzzle? yes

	What is the word I'm looking for? Abadeer

	That's it!!!! You solved my puzzle
	Don't tell princess B I helped you guys!!!
	My password is 'My friend Finn'



So we get password of micheline
	micheline:My friend Finn
	
Bingo we are connected and we can catch the second flag

Hello Finn,

I heard that you pulled a fast one over the banana guards.
B was very upset hahahahaha.
I also heard you guys are looking for BMO's resetcode.
You guys broke him again with those silly games?

You know I like you Finn, but I don't want to anger B too much.
So I will help you a little bit...

But you have to solve my little puzzle. Think you're up for it?
Hahahahaha....I know you are.

so we'll try decrypting that from spoon

output --> The magic word you are looking for is ApplePie

i'll try with the port 31337 to see the answer.

Bingooo it works ......
	nc land-of-ooo.com 31337
	Hello Princess Bubblegum. What is the magic word?
	ApplePie
	The password of peppermint-butler is: That Black Magic

so we got a new username and password --> peppermint-butler:That Black Magic
	peppermint-butler@at:~$ cat flag3
	flag3---------->tryhackme{N0Bl4ckM4g1cH3r3}


------------------Founding 4th flag------------
we have a jpg file on peppermint-butler account so we will download it to see if we will found sth interresting in the image.

python3 -m http.server 

we try it but it have a password.
so we will try finding files with permissions of the current user

--> find / -user peppermint-butler -type f 2>/dev/null
	peppermint-butler@at:~$ find / -user peppermint-butler -type f 2>/dev/null
	/usr/share/xml/steg.txt
	/etc/php/zip.txt

We will open the first one /usr/share/xml/steg.txt
	peppermint-butler@at:~$ cat /usr/share/xml/steg.txt
	I need to keep my secrets safe.
	There are people in this castle who can't be trusted.
	Those banana guards are not the smartest of guards.
	And that Marceline is a friend of princess Bubblegum,
	but I don't trust her.

	So I need to keep this safe.

	The password of my secret file is 'ToKeepASecretSafe'
	
----extracting the file on it---------
	steghide extract -sf butler-1.jpg 
	Enter passphrase: 
	wrote extracted data to "secrets.zip".

We come back and try to unzip secret file but it have a password now we have to found the secret file password.

	peppermint-butler@at:~$ cat /etc/php/zip.txt

	[0200 hours][upper stairs]
	I was looking for my arch nemesis Peace Master, 
	but instead I saw that cowering little puppet from the Ice King.....gunter.
	What was he up to, I don't know.
	But I saw him sneaking in the secret lab of Princess Bubblegum.
	To be able to see what he was doing I used my spell 'the evil eye' and saw him.
	He was hacking the secret laptop with something small like a duck of rubber.
	I had to look closely, but I think I saw him type in something.
	It was unclear, but it was something like 'The Ice King s????'.
	The last 4 letters where a blur.

	Should I tell princess Bubblegum or see how this all plays out?
	I don't know.......
	
	
	We will use the crunch to create a password dictionary that can be used to perform Bruteforce. 
	We used the @ wildcard to make the combination of all the possible passwords and moved them into a text file by the name of file.txt.
